# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
  user = User.create(email: 'test@mail.ru' , password: '111111', password_confirmation: '111111')
